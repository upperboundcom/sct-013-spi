# sct-013-spi
Nodejs module to read data from a SCT-013 AC current sensor over SPI

This is meant for use with a Raspberry Pi and a MDC3008 ADC chip.

This module is pretty raw and doesn't get proper current readings yet, but at least responds to current changes with the right kind of circuitry attached.

It's a new work in progress. Don't use this yet for anything important.

I'll post more information on usage as I develop this.
